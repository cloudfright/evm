Eulerian Video Magnification 

## Description

[Eulerian Video Magnification](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/) (EVM) can be used to detect subtle changes in colour and movement in world around us. For instance, EVM can be used to detect the heart rate of a person by measuring the subtle changes in skin colour as blood flows through the body.

## Project goals 

- Build a real time heart rate monitor using just a camera  
- Single or multi-person capability 
- Tolerant to movement and changes in lighting
- Explore the possibility of using EVM for other applications such as detecting breathing rate, blood pressure, etc.
- Explore the feasibility of running on mobile devices and Rasberry Pi
